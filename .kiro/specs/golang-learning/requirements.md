# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on establishing a comprehensive Go (Golang) learning environment within the existing competitive programming and algorithm study repository. The goal is to add Go as a primary language option alongside Python, enabling practice of competitive programming problems, algorithm implementations, and technical interview preparation using Go's unique features and performance characteristics.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a competitive programmer, I want to solve algorithm problems using Go, so that I can leverage Go's performance benefits and learn its syntax through practical application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I encounter a new algorithm problem THEN the system SHALL provide Go implementation templates and examples
2. WHEN I implement solutions in Go THEN the system SHALL support standard competitive programming patterns (fast I/O, common data structures)
3. WHEN I need to test Go solutions THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate build and execution commands

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer studying algorithms, I want to implement core data structures and algorithms in Go, so that I can build a reusable library similar to the existing Python Libs directory.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I implement algorithms in Go THEN the system SHALL organize them in a structured library format
2. WHEN I create Go implementations THEN the system SHALL include proper documentation and examples
3. WHEN I need algorithm references THEN the system SHALL provide Go versions of common algorithms (sorting, searching, graph algorithms, etc.)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a learner, I want structured Go language fundamentals and examples, so that I can understand Go-specific concepts like goroutines, channels, and interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I study Go fundamentals THEN the system SHALL provide examples of Go-specific features (goroutines, channels, interfaces, error handling)
2. WHEN I practice Go syntax THEN the system SHALL include progressive examples from basic to advanced concepts
3. WHEN I need reference materials THEN the system SHALL provide Go best practices and idioms documentation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a competitive programmer, I want to convert existing Python solutions to Go, so that I can compare performance and learn Go syntax through familiar problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select Python solutions for conversion THEN the system SHALL identify suitable candidates for Go implementation
2. WHEN I convert solutions THEN the system SHALL maintain the same algorithmic approach while using Go idioms
3. WHEN I compare implementations THEN the system SHALL provide performance benchmarking capabilities

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Go project structure and tooling setup, so that I can efficiently develop, test, and run Go programs within the repository.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I work with Go code THEN the system SHALL provide proper module structure and dependency management
2. WHEN I build Go programs THEN the system SHALL include appropriate Makefile or build scripts
3. WHEN I test Go implementations THEN the system SHALL support Go's testing framework and benchmarking tools

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a technical interview candidate, I want to practice coding problems in Go, so that I can demonstrate proficiency in multiple programming languages during interviews.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I practice interview problems THEN the system SHALL provide Go solutions for common technical interview questions
2. WHEN I study system design THEN the system SHALL include Go-specific implementation examples for distributed systems concepts
3. WHEN I prepare for interviews THEN the system SHALL provide Go coding patterns and best practices relevant to technical interviews
