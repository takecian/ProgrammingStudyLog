# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a comprehensive Python coding interview preparation system that teaches problem-solving patterns, provides structured practice, and builds upon the existing competitive programming foundation. The system will focus on the most common interview question types and Python-specific techniques that are essential for technical interviews at major tech companies.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a software engineer preparing for coding interviews, I want a structured learning path for Python problem-solving patterns, so that I can systematically build my skills and confidence for technical interviews.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the learning system THEN I SHALL see a clear progression of topics from basic to advanced
2. WHEN I complete a topic THEN the system SHALL track my progress and suggest the next appropriate topic
3. IF I am a beginner THEN the system SHALL start with fundamental data structures and algorithms
4. WHEN I view a topic THEN I SHALL see the problem-solving pattern, Python implementation techniques, and time/space complexity analysis

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an interview candidate, I want to practice the most common coding interview question types with Python-specific solutions, so that I can recognize patterns and apply optimal approaches during real interviews.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I practice problems THEN I SHALL have access to questions covering arrays, strings, linked lists, trees, graphs, dynamic programming, and system design
2. WHEN I solve a problem THEN I SHALL see multiple solution approaches with trade-offs explained
3. WHEN I review solutions THEN I SHALL see Python-specific optimizations and built-in library usage
4. IF a problem has multiple approaches THEN I SHALL see both brute force and optimized solutions with complexity analysis

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Python developer, I want to learn interview-specific Python techniques and idioms, so that I can write clean, efficient code during time-pressured interview situations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I study Python techniques THEN I SHALL learn about list comprehensions, dictionary operations, set operations, and built-in functions for interviews
2. WHEN I practice coding THEN I SHALL see examples of using collections (defaultdict, Counter, deque), heapq, bisect, and itertools
3. WHEN I write solutions THEN I SHALL follow Python best practices for readability and efficiency
4. IF I use advanced Python features THEN I SHALL understand when and why to use them in interview contexts

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As someone preparing for technical interviews, I want to practice problem-solving under time constraints with immediate feedback, so that I can simulate real interview conditions and improve my performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I start a practice session THEN I SHALL be able to set time limits similar to interview conditions (30-45 minutes per problem)
2. WHEN I submit a solution THEN I SHALL receive immediate feedback on correctness, efficiency, and code quality
3. WHEN I struggle with a problem THEN I SHALL have access to progressive hints that guide me toward the solution
4. IF I complete a problem THEN I SHALL see similar problems to reinforce the pattern

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to understand the thought process behind solving coding problems, so that I can develop systematic problem-solving skills rather than just memorizing solutions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I study a solution THEN I SHALL see the step-by-step thought process from problem analysis to final implementation
2. WHEN I encounter a new problem type THEN I SHALL learn the general approach and how to identify similar problems
3. WHEN I practice THEN I SHALL develop skills in breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts
4. IF I make mistakes THEN I SHALL understand common pitfalls and how to avoid them

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an interview candidate, I want to practice explaining my solutions clearly, so that I can effectively communicate my thought process during real interviews.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I solve a problem THEN I SHALL practice explaining my approach in clear, structured language
2. WHEN I review solutions THEN I SHALL see examples of how to explain the solution to an interviewer
3. WHEN I encounter edge cases THEN I SHALL learn how to identify and discuss them during interviews
4. IF I optimize a solution THEN I SHALL practice explaining the trade-offs and reasoning behind the optimization
