# Design Document

## Overview

The Python Interview Preparation System will be a comprehensive learning platform that builds upon the existing competitive programming foundation to create a structured interview preparation experience. The system will leverage the current repository structure while adding new components specifically designed for interview success.

The design focuses on creating a progressive learning path that transforms competitive programming skills into interview-ready problem-solving abilities, emphasizing Python-specific techniques, clear communication, and systematic thinking processes.

        """Begin a timed practice session"""
    
    def request_hint(self) -> str:
        """Provide progressive hints without giving away the solution"""
    
    def submit_solution(self, code: str) -> FeedbackReport:

## Python-Specific Optimizations

### Built-in Function Mastery
```python
# Essential built-ins for interviews
techniques = {
    'enumerate': 'for i, val in enumerate(arr)',
    'zip': 'for a, b in zip(list1, list2)',
    'map': 'list(map(int, input().split()))',
    'filter': 'list(filter(lambda x: x > 0, nums))',
    'any/all': 'any(x > 0 for x in nums)',
    'sorted': 'sorted(nums, key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))'
}
```

### Collections Module Usage
```python
from collections import defaultdict, Counter, deque

# Common interview patterns
graph = defaultdict(list)  # Adjacency list
freq = Counter(words)      # Frequency counting
queue = deque()           # BFS queue
```

### List Comprehensions and Generators
```python
# Memory-efficient solutions
squares = [x*x for x in range(10)]
even_squares = [x*x for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]
matrix_transpose = [[row[i] for row in matrix] for i in range(len(matrix[0]))]
```

This design leverages your existing competitive programming expertise while adding the structured learning and communication skills needed for technical interviews. The system builds incrementally from your current foundation, making it easy to transition from contest problem-solving to interview preparation.
