## Core Data Models

### Problem
Represents a coding interview problem with multiple solutions, examples, and metadata.

### Solution
Contains different approaches to solve a problem with complexity analysis and explanations.

### UserProgress
Tracks learning progress, practice session results, and performance metrics.

## Getting Started

1. **Choose Your Level**: Start with the appropriate difficulty level based on your experience
2. **Follow Learning Paths**: Use the structured progression through problem-solving patterns
3. **Practice Regularly**: Use timed practice sessions to simulate interview conditions
4. **Track Progress**: Monitor your improvement and identify areas for focus

## Pattern Categories

- **Two Pointers**: Efficient traversal techniques
- **Sliding Window**: Optimal subarray/substring problems
- **Tree Traversal**: BFS and DFS on trees
- **Dynamic Programming**: Complex optimization problems
- **Graph Algorithms**: Graph traversal and pathfinding

## Features

- ✅ Structured learning paths from beginner to advanced
- ✅ Timed practice sessions with immediate feedback
- ✅ Python-specific optimizations and idioms
- ✅ Progress tracking and performance analytics
- ✅ Communication guides for explaining solutions
- ✅ Integration with existing competitive programming solutions

## Next Steps

This is the foundation structure. The system will be built incrementally with:
1. Pattern implementations and problem libraries
2. Practice session management
3. Communication and explanation tools
4. Advanced analytics and recommendations

Start by exploring the configuration files to understand the learning structure, then begin implementing specific patterns based on your needs.
